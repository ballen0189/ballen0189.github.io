	<p><i>Supernatural</i> is great! I have been watching it for about 5 years now, on and off. Two brothers, Sam and Dean, 
	must fight the evils of the world while trying to stay alive themselves. When I say evils, I mean supernatural 
	beings such as vampires, ghosts, demons, and etc. The two are considered hunters and they aren't the only ones 
	in America or on Earth that is. In fact, their father and mother were hunters and passed the tradition to them.  
	The two have been fighing these evils for 14 seasons now and will end on the 15th season.</p>
	
	<ul>

			<li><p>The main characters, Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, are close in real
			life like they appear in the TV show. </p></li>
			<li><p>Originally, Kripke wanted to name Sam as “Sal”.</p></li>
